Any time I see a system that looks broken, I always try to figure out how it
could be better. What does
[the ideal system](https://joshuapullen.com/blog/posts/the-ideal-school/) look
like? Answering this question is fun, but it is ultimately unproductive. As a
recreational activity, attempting to design the perfect system is great, but
real change requires a different approach.

Too many times I've been burned by attempting to plot the perfect course before
I set sail. Any time I begin a project this way, one of two things happens:

1. I
   [lose stamina](https://basecamp.com/gettingreal/07.4-seek-and-celebrate-small-victories)
   because I've bitten off more than I can chew.
2. I realize that my mental model of the problem
   [doesn't match reality](https://basecamp.com/gettingreal/06.1-race-to-running-software).

This lesson has been hard-fought. Making big plans is fun, and executing big
plans is hard, so each time I start a new project I spend more time planning and
less time acting.

Plus, beginning a journey without a map feels like poor planning. But the
alternative is to create the map before leaving home. Don't do this; your map
will be totally wrong! Making a plan before acting is just
extrapolating—poorly—from the information you already have. Travelling with a
guess at a plan _feels_ safer than traveling without one, but it isn't.

Instead, the correct approach is a sort of real-life gradient descent. Don't
plan. Instead, look around for a moment and take a reasonable first step. Then
reevaluate and step again. Rinse and repeat.

This is great news, because small steps are easy. Convincing yourself to do
something small is far easier than making the entire plan up-front. No story
demonstrates this better than the parable of _stone soup_ found in
[The Pragmatic Programmer](https://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X):

The parable of stone soup is clearly about convincing—no, _tricking_—other
people to join a project, but the target doesn't have to be someone else. You
can trick yourself too! Taking small steps makes big actions easy. Take
advantage of that fact, and start small today.
