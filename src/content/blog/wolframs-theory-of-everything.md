title: "Wolfram's theory of everything is interesting, profitable, and probably
  wrong."
author: "Josh Pullen"

Stephen Wolfram just presented
[a new fundamental theory for how the universe works](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/)
that claims to unite quantum mechanics and general relativity. Here are a few
highlights:

- Time takes place in discrete steps, like the frames of a movie.
- Quantum mechanics and general relativity are both caused by the
  [same thing](https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/the-updating-process-for-string-substitution-systems/the-phenomenon-of-causal-invariance/).
- The number of spacial dimensions can change over time, and
  [doesn't have to be an integer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_dimension).

Wolfram's
[original article](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/)
does a good job of explaining the theory quite simply, but it's still worth
summarizing these ideas briefly.

## Time takes place in discrete steps.

This one is awesome. Anyone who has edited a video or coded a video game knows
that action takes place in a set of discrete "frames", one right after another.
Under wolfram's proposed theory, the universe works the same way. There is a
process that takes the state of the universe at one moment in time and
transforms it into the next. Repeating this process generates a series of
snapshots of the universe at each moment in time. Unlike existing models of
physics, there is no "in between". If a ball travels from x=1 to x=2, there is
no guarantee that it will ever hit exactly x=√2.

This is a very comforting concept. In the universe, big things and small things
look mostly the same. The force of gravity pulling together two atoms in a
vacuum looks the same as the force between two planets. The scale changes, but
the structure doesn't. Interestingly, this theory of the universe looks a lot
like the inside of a computer, and computers often serve as mini universes of
their own. If our mini universes match the big universe, that seems to fit with
the fractal-like nature of everything.

## Quantum mechanics and general relativity are the same.

Speaking of small and large things, Wolfram's theory combines two seemingly
contradictory theories about the way that little and big things behave. The
theory states that
[relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_relativity) and the
[observer effect](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_effect_(physics)>) are
both caused by what has been named
"[causal invariance](https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/the-updating-process-for-string-substitution-systems/the-phenomenon-of-causal-invariance/)".

Causal invariance begins with the idea that when the universe takes a "step",
there are sometimes multiple options for what it can do. This is analogous to
the adding three numbers. You can begin by adding the first two or by adding the
second two. Ultimately, however, you will converge on the same answer no matter
which path you choose.

In Wolfram's proposed model of the universe, all possible variations take place
simultaneously. Eventually, however, these branches (almost) always reconvene on
the same answer.

These splices and re-convenings of the universe are the foundation of Wolfram's
explanation for both relativity and the observer effect. The idea in both cases
is that two observers can see the world differently, but yet they will
eventually agree.

## Dimensions are flexible.

The Wolfram model proposes that "space" and "stuff" are the same, both made up
of nodes in one big network. In this abstract arena, measuring dimensionality is
a bit tricky.

First, consider a cool property of differently-dimensioned shapes: The area of a
2D circle is proportional to r<sup>2</sup>, but the volume of a 3D sphere is
proportional to r<sup>3</sup>. The rate of size increase depends on the number
of dimensions.

In a network, dimensionality can be measured by applying this fact in reverse.
Start at a single node, then expand out to select all connected nodes. Then
expand again to select all the next connected nodes. After repeating this
process n times, how many nodes are selected? If the answer is proportional to
n<sup>2</sup>, then the network is 2D. If it's proportional to n<sup>3</sup>,
the network is 3D. Here's the illustration provided by Wolfram himself:

![Dimensionality](/images/posts/wolframs-theory-of-everything/dimensionality.png)

Of course, in a network like this, dimensionality is just a rough approximation,
with two unintuitive properties:

- Dimensionality doesn't have to be an integer! A 1.5D network is completely
  valid.
- Dimensionality doesn't need to be uniform throughout the network. As you move
  through space, the number of dimensions can change.

# Is this marketing?

Absolutely! All throughout the announcement of his theory, Stephen references
the Wolfram Language and uses it to generate diagrams of networks. There's even
an entire section dedicated to programming language design which flaunts Wolfram
Language and its ability to simulate this model of the universe.

That's okay. Elon Musk has demonstrated that pursuing financially viable
scientific exploration is a great way to make rapid advancements. Financially
sustainable research is better than science which requires donations to stay
afloat. Making money allows the science to sustain itself, and focuses efforts
on making advancements which benefit society.

# Is this _correct_?

If you're trying to predict whether a "theory of everything" is correct, you'd
be hard-pressed to find a better algorithm than to always say "no". This theory
is almost certainly wrong, but that doesn't mean it should be shunned.
Attempting to understand the universe is a valid, virtuous choice. Being wrong
is okay. Earning a profit is okay. The only true failure is to never try.
