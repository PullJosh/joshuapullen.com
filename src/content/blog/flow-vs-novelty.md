title: "The Need for Flow vs The Need for Novelty"

_I want to be creative._ It's a feeling I have often. Sometimes it leads to amazing experiences, but sometimes it doesn't. I think I know why.

**I am conflating two different feelings.** What I identify as the desire to be creative is actually two different desires. I could be searching for a **flow state** or for **novelty**.

Flow states are awesome, and I'm good at finding them. Under the right conditions, I can bury my head in an ongoing project and knock out four solid hours of sweat equity, delighting in every second of it.

But if my true desire is for novelty, attempting to dial in a work session backfires. I don't want to work on my existing projects, so I decide that I need to start some other new project. Bad idea. This just leads to a trail of unfinished things.

**New plan:** If I recognize that I am craving novelty (rather than a flow state), don't commit to projects. Just play. Try something goofy. Instead of beating myself up for failing to do creative _work_, put some googly eyes on a sock or attempt a cartwheel. Anything new.
