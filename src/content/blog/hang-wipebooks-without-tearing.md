title: How to Hang Wipebooks So They Don't Tear
author: "Josh Pullen"

I wanted some additional whiteboard space in my classroom, so I aquired some Wipebooks with the plan to hang them on my back wall. (Actually, I won them; thank you [Knowles](https://knowlesteachers.org/)!)

# The Problem

My plan was to hang the Wipebooks directly from command hooks. Unfortunately, the hooks tore right through the wipebook page.

# The Solution

I tried reinforcing with duct tape, but the tape began to tear too. Eventually I found a better solution: **Use a binder clip.**

With the binder clip pinching the Wipebook, the force is distributed and I've never had one tear again. Even with a really tough pull, I suspect the Wipebook would just slip out of the binder clip without breaking.
