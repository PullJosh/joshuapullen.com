School is fundamentally broken, far beyond what most people believe. A radical
new school could be an order of magnitude more effective at helping students
learn and be happy. I know this is possible because I learned as much from
[Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) (plus the passion for code it inspired
within me) as I did from my entire middle school and high school experience
combined.

To recreate the life-changing experience I had with programming—originally
initiated by Scratch—in school, that school must do the following:

1. Create tools that allow students to be designers, inventors, and artists.
   Scratch is a great example. The tools must be easy to start using without any
   instructions, but they should also be very powerful for students who learn to
   use them well. Ideally, these tools should serve as
   [ideal mental models](http://michaelnielsen.org/reinventing_explanation/index.html)
   for thinking.
2. Create an environment in which students have access to a wide variety of
   these tools. Give them the freedom to explore the space. Ideally, this would
   take place in a physical building where students can interact with each
   other. In the physical space, tools should _not_ be grouped by type. Instead,
   they should be scattered around so that ideas cross-pollinate between
   different subjects.
3. Provide an easily-searchable library of resources that allow students to look
   for solutions to the problems they encounter while building things. (It might
   also be valuable to have in-person instructors who can guide students to
   resources that they
   [don't know they need](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/988332-some-people-say-give-the-customers-what-they-want-but).)
4. Allow students to publish their work and receive feedback. In most cases,
   this would mean sharing work with other students in some publicly-visible
   forum. Hang artwork on a public bulletin board. Build an arcade machine that
   only plays games created by students. Project a continuous slideshow of
   student photography. Allow musical performances by students, and encourage
   other students to attend. In every case, make it easy for students to give
   each other feedback.

   When possible, enable students to share their work with the outside world.
   Ideally, this would mean that students are solving real-life problems and
   assisting the community. Only do this when the external interaction is
   genuinely useful for all parties involved. Students are smart, and will see
   through any mock "helping". Save the simulations of usefulness for within the
   bounds of the classroom, and interact with the outside world only when it is
   valuable to everyone.

This radical shift away from the traditional school model would be vastly more
effective for K-12 students. Giving students the freedom to explore
fundamentally changes their outlook on education. (_"Learning is fun and enables
me to tackle interesting, important problems._") Of course, radical change is
scary, and people will have some lingering questions:

**How do you force students to learn particular things?** You don't. You provide
high-quality tools in the subject areas worth understanding. Students choose to
specialize in what they are interested in. (A few choose to "specialize" as
polymaths.) Students are continually exposed to new ideas and work from their
fellow students, but they do what they enjoy.

**What if nobody chooses to learn a particular skill?** There are two
possibilities:

1. The subject is being presented poorly. Fix this by providing tools which are
   easier to use and more powerful.
2. The skill isn't actually useful and students know it. Good job kids.

School has the opportunity to set students on track as learners for life, but
right now schools are structured to squander that chance. It is imperative that
we restructure school around giving students agency and encouraging them to
solve problems. Our futures all depend on students growing up to do great
things. Giving them an environment that enables learning is the least we can do.
