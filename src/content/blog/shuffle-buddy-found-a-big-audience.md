I've been **shocked** by [the reception to Shuffle Buddy](/blog/oops-im-a-famous-tiktoker-now). Over 1 million people have seen my videos, and by my back-of-the-napkin math, I think a whopping **5% of all US teachers** have watched one my Shuffle Buddy videos _to the end_ (full retention).

I'm not an entertainer‚Äìand I'm not that pretty‚Äìbut Shuffle Buddy went viral anyway. The two most successful videos were just _product demos_. When I tried to get fancy with it, the videos flopped. Based on the comments, it's clear that people were excited because the product met clear need.

# Product, meet market.

Business terms make me squirm, but I've just gotten a full-contact crash course in **product-market fit**. Everybody from kindergarden teachers to bus drivers have shared that Shuffle Buddy solves a big problem in their life.

This has been a massive validation of [my life choice](/blog/traction-against-the-world) to pursue edtech development by becoming a classroom teacher, not a computer programmer.

As software products go, Shuffle Buddy is pretty simple. I rewrote the core shuffling algorithm in my hotel room at 1:30am. The computer science is not what makes it special.

Shuffle Buddy's unique value is the ability to _shuffle with rules_, which is obvious to every teacher who has tried to randomize a seating chart.

Somehow, nobody had built it yet.
