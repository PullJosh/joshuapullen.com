It's easy for summer days to waste away. It's also easy for me to get distracted by lots of fun projects without following through on the projects I've already started. To solve this, I've developed the "Get Swole Summer" progress board.

Here are my goals.

# 1. Shuffle Buddy

**Product Improvements:**

- Implement features & fixes that address 90% of the [user feedback](/blog/you-dont-know-your-users-until-you-watch-them) I received at the Knowles Spring conference

**Increase User Base:**

- Present in-person to groups of at least 10 people at least two separate times
- Create at least 6 blog posts/landing pages that will receive a lot of backlinks (leading to good SEO)
- Engage in online communities, receiving comments from at least 15 different people who I havenâ€™t met in real life.
- Outcome: Collect email addresses from at least 30 people who are interested in receiving Shuffle Buddy updates & reminders

# 2. "Teachers Pay Teachers" Activities

**Publish Activities:**

- Publish at least 20 activities to TPT covering at least five distinct math topics in at least four different activity formats

**Automate Activity Templates:**

- Automate the process of generating at least two different activity formats
- Automate the process of generating at least 10 different math question types

# 3. Blog

- Write two blog posts per week for all but two weeks of the summer

# 4. Exercise

- Walk every morning
- Go to the gym at least 4 times per week
- Run at least 3 times per week
