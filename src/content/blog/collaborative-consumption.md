Productivity feels great, but it's a lot of work. If you're anything like me, the natural defense mechanism is to read books, listen to podcasts, watch YouTube videos, skim articles, etc., but not actually _do_ anything.

Consuming "productivity" content gives the impression of productivity without actually accomplishing anything at all. **By satisfying the _urge_ to be productive, you never have to _actually_ do anything.** Phew!

# Breaking the consumption loop

**Whenever you consume a new idea, you must act on what you learned before consuming something new.** That's the only rule. The action can be big or small. If you begin consuming something and realize it won't be actionable, stop consuming it.

This keeps the onus on action.

# Consume, create, communicate

To replace the consumption loop with a collaborative loop, give back to the sources you're learning from.

Whoever wrote that book, made that video, or recorded that podcast would love to get your feedback and see what you've achieved. And every time you share, you're putting yourself out there and [creating opportunities for luck](https://modelthinkers.com/mental-model/surface-area-of-luck).

What goes around comes around.
